## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze different dimensions of the bike ride dataset. These dimensions include number of rides, time of ride, duration of ride, and gender.

## Results
![checkoutTimesByGender](checkoutTimesByGender.png)
Males are most represented here.

![checkoutTimesForUsers](checkoutTimesForUsers.png)
Most rides have a shorter duration.

![genderBreakdown](genderBreakdown.png)
There are more males than other genders (over 75%!).

![numberOfTrips](numberOfTrips.png)
There are about 2.3M trips in this data set.

![tripsByWeekdayForEachHour](tripsByWeekdayForEachHour.png)
Most trips occur during rush hour (8am and 5pm) during weekdays. Weekends have a more uniform distribution during waking hours (9am to 5pm).

![tripsByGender](tripsByGender.png)
The overall cyclical pattern by time of day is consistent between men and women.

![tripsByGenderByWeekday](tripsByGenderByWeekday.png)
Male subscribers are by far the largest represented group here.

## Summary
Overall, male subscribers are best represented group.
I would recommend two additional visualizations for further analysis:
1. Male subscribers vs. female subscribers number of rides by weekday vs. weekend
2. Overall number of rides by weekday vs. weekend
